"""Automatic lossless intermediary, for a template.vpy with a rescale in it.

A rescale is the slowest thing a filtering script can hold, and an encode reads
the video more than once: Auto-Boost filters for the fast pass and again for the
final one, Condor filters once per target-quality probe, and a resumed run starts
over. Filtering an episode three times through ArtCNN costs hours that buy
nothing - the filtered frames are identical every time.

So when bat-builder.py has turned the mode on - video-input\\lossless-intermediary.txt
is there - the filter chain runs ONCE into a mathematically lossless x264 file
and everything after that reads the file:

    source.mkv --[template.vpy, rescale and all]--> temp\\lossless\\source-lossless.mkv
    temp\\lossless\\source-lossless.mkv --[passthrough .vpy]--> the AV1 encode

Nothing about this is a step the user takes. prepare() is called by whichever
dispatcher is building the filtering script, before it builds one, and hands
back the intermediary; the dispatcher then renders a passthrough script over it
instead of the template. The source file, the output name, the audio mux, scene
detection and the zones file are all untouched and still the original's.

ONE AT A TIME. These files are around 40 GB for a 24 minute 1080p episode, so
the folder holds one and prepare() deletes the last one before it builds the
next. The folder is under temp, which tools/cleanup.py removes at the end of
every .bat, so the last one goes with it.

REUSE. The intermediary carries a stamp of the template text and the source path
it was built from - the same stamp the rendered .vpy files use. A resumed run
finds it unchanged and skips straight to encoding; an edited template.vpy
changes the stamp and it is rebuilt.

The encode recipe is av1an's, and the same one video-input\\x264.bat uses:
one chunk, one worker, --qp 0. Chunk boundaries have no place in a file that is
meant to be lossless, and one chunk cannot use more than one worker anyway.
Video only, deliberately: a VapourSynth script carries no audio, and the
dispatcher muxes the original's audio onto the finished AV1 encode later.

Consumers:
  * av1an-dispatch.py     (Av1an single pass, and Condor through it)
  * Auto-Boost-Av1an.py   (Auto-Boost two pass)

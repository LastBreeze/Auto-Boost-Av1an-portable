"""AfterZone - apply a zones.txt to an encode that has ALREADY finished.

Normally zones have to be decided before the encoder starts. AfterZone lets you
decide afterwards: you watch the finished file, note the scenes you are not
happy with, write a zones.txt, and AfterZone re-encodes only those parts.

Both encoders this package ships are supported, and which one produced an
encode is read off the working folder it left behind rather than guessed:

    .<hash>\\chunks.json + .<hash>\\done.json + encode\\NNNNN.ivf   av1an
    .<hash>\\cmd.txt     + .<hash>\\done.txt  + encode\\NNNN.obu    LQTC

The two halves of this file mirror each other: the av1an notes are immediately
below, the LQTC ones are at "LQTC working folders" further down. Everything in
between - the zones file, the bitrate analysis, the plan, the split logic and
the in-progress marker - is shared.

How it works (av1an)
--------------------
When av1an runs with --keep, its working folder survives:

    .<hash>\\chunks.json   one entry per chunk, each with its own start_frame /
                           end_frame and video_params
    .<hash>\\done.json     {"frames":N,"done":{"00003":{...}},...}
    .<hash>\\encode\\*.ivf every finished chunk

That .<hash> folder ends up in one of two places, because av1an names it after
a hash of the input path and creates it in whatever folder it was run from:

    temp\\<name>\\.<hash>     Auto-Boost .bat files. Auto-Boost-Av1an.py runs
                             av1an in video-input\\<name>\\, and dispatch.py
                             moves that whole folder to temp\\<name>\\ afterwards.
                             The .vpy sits next to it in temp\\<name>\\.
    video-input\\.<hash>      av1an-only .bat files. av1an-dispatch.py runs
                             av1an in video-input itself, so the folder is
                             created there and is never moved. The .vpy for
                             these lives in temp\\<name>.vpy.

Both are searched. The folder name is a hash, so a loose .<hash> in video-input
is matched to its input file by the .vpy path recorded in its chunks.json.

On --resume, av1an reads chunks.json, throws away every chunk whose name is a
key in done.json, and encodes the rest with the video_params stored in
chunks.json.  It performs no freshness check on either file, and the final
concat simply reads whatever .ivf files are in encode\\.

So AfterZone does exactly this, per chunk that a zone touches:
  1. rewrite that chunk's video_params in chunks.json with the zone's params
  2. delete its done.json entry
  3. move its encode\\NNNNN.ivf out of the way
then re-runs av1an with --resume.  Untouched chunks are never re-encoded.

A zone edge that lands inside a chunk splits that chunk in two, which is what
av1an itself does with --zones during a fresh encode: chunks.json is just a
list, so the entry is replaced by one entry per piece, each with its own
start_frame/end_frame, its own frame range in source_cmd, and its own
video_params.  A zone covering frames 300-500 of a 100-500 chunk therefore
gives frames 100-300 the original parameters and 300-500 the zone's.

Both pieces still have to be encoded, because the existing .ivf covers the
whole original chunk and cannot be cut, so splitting costs the same encode
time as re-encoding the chunk whole -- what it buys is the parameters being
right per piece.  It also puts a keyframe at the split, exactly as a fresh
--zones encode would.

Inserting entries renumbers every chunk after the split, because a chunk's
name is "{index:05}" and all three of av1an's concat methods depend on that
numbering being contiguous from zero.  AfterZone therefore also renames the
encoded .ivf files and re-keys done.json, and writes a rename-map json into
afterzone-backup\\ before it touches anything.

Chunks that cannot be split fall back to taking the zone across their whole
range: multi-pass chunks (both pieces would share one --stats file) and
chunks whose source_cmd has no frame range AfterZone recognizes.  Either way
it prints exactly which frames are affected before it changes anything.

How it works (LQTC)
-------------------
LQTC keeps the same kind of working folder, also under --keep, but everything
in it is its own format and its zones are native: the scene list doubles as the
zones file, because anything written after the start frame on a line is passed
to the encoder for that scene alone.  So AfterZone writes the zone's parameters
onto the scene's line, deletes that chunk's line from done.txt, moves its
encode\\NNNN.obu aside and re-runs the command LQTC recorded in cmd.txt, which
resumes at every chunk done.txt no longer lists.  Splitting works the same way
as for av1an - a zone edge inside a scene inserts a new start frame - and
renumbers the later chunks, which is why done.txt, chunks.json and the .obu
files are renumbered with it.  See "LQTC working folders" below for the layout.

An LQTC encode chooses its own CRF per scene with the quality target search, so
a zone that sets --crf overrides that search for the scenes it covers, and a
zone that does not sets everything else and lets the search run again.

That scene file is the whole zone mechanism for LQTC -- nothing else AfterZone
writes carries a single encoder parameter -- which makes losing it the one
failure that cannot be noticed while it is happening. A scene list that keeps
its frame numbers and loses its parameters still resumes cleanly, still
re-encodes every chunk the plan freed, and reproduces the encode that was
already there chunk for chunk: hours of work, no error, and an output the same
size as the one it replaced. So it is not assumed to have been written. Before
anything is touched the file is proved writable (Windows refuses to open a
read-only file for writing, and the attribute survives being moved to temp\\ and
staged back, so make_writable clears it first); it is read back and compared
against the plan the moment it is written; and it is compared again against the
file the recorded command actually names, immediately before LQTC is launched.
Any mismatch stops the run while the backups are still good. A resumed run
cannot write zones by definition, so it reports how many scenes carry
parameters and asks before encoding when the answer is none.

zones.txt format (one zone per line, blank lines and #-comments ignored):

    start_frame end_frame encoder [reset] encoder_params
    0 2157 svt-av1 --crf 28 --psy-rd 0.6
    31769 -1 svt-av1 --crf 30 --tf-strength 3

end_frame is exclusive; -1 means "to the end of the video".  Without the
optional `reset` keyword the zone's params are MERGED onto the params that
chunk was originally encoded with (matching flags are replaced, new flags are
appended), so you only need to list what you want to change.  With `reset`,
the zone's params replace the chunk's params completely.  Every parameter is
passed to the encoder, which is how the .bat files in this package already
handle things like --photon-noise.

For LQTC the merge is done by the encoder rather than here: a scene's own
parameters are applied on top of the global ones the encode was started with,
so a zone line only ever has to name what it changes.  `reset` therefore has
nothing to act on and is ignored (with a warning) for LQTC encodes.

Output goes to video-output\\<name>-afterzone.mkv.  The original
video-output\\<name>-output.mkv is never touched, so you can compare them.

Interrupted runs
----------------
As soon as the encoder's state files are about to be rewritten, AfterZone drops
a marker in temp\\afterzone-active-<name>.txt naming the file it is encoding,
the working folder it is encoding into, the worker count and the chunk counts.
While that marker exists AfterZone modifies nothing: it skips zones, planning
and every file operation, and simply restarts the encoder, which continues at
the first chunk it has no completion record for.  So the window can be closed
in the middle of an encode, and running AfterZone.bat again picks it up where
it stopped.  The marker is deleted once the result is muxed into video-output.

For LQTC that also covers moving its working folder and scene file back into
video-input, which is the only place it looks for them.  That is a move rather
than an edit, so it happens on a resumed run too, and the pair is returned to
temp\\ once the result is muxed.

Worker count
------------
Every .bat in this package writes a tools\\bat-used-<name>.bat.txt marker as it
starts.  AfterZone reads the newest marker that is not its own and uses that
.bat's custom-av1an-workers value when the one-time optimization benchmark has
filled it in, so it encodes with the same worker count the original encode ran
with.  The name of that .bat is remembered in tools\\afterzone-lastbat.txt,
because AfterZone.bat clears tools\\bat*.txt before this script starts.  With
no .bat to read, tools\\workercount-config.txt is used exactly as before.

None of that applies to an LQTC encode: its worker count is part of the command
line in cmd.txt, which AfterZone re-runs unchanged, so the re-encode always uses
the same -w and -v the encode itself ran with.

Run this via AfterZone.bat (it sets PATH and the encoder-settings tag).

#                       state: LQTC encodes every chunk with no line here.
#   .<hash>\chunks.json one JSON object per line recording the quality target
#                       search for a chunk (its probes and the CRF it settled
#                       on), appended as chunks finish. It is only read again

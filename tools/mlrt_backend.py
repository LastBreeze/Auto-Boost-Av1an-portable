"""Inference backends for the rescale section of video-input\\template.vpy.

The rescale block the template writer can add descales an anime source to its
native production resolution and rebuilds it with ArtCNN, which is an ONNX model
run through vs-mlrt. vs-jetpack 2 drives that through vsscale.Backend rather
than the standalone vsmlrt module, but the plugin side is the same one: an
inference backend has to be there, and which one is available decides how fast
the rescale is:

  DirectML     ships with this package. vsort.dll plus DirectML.dll and
               onnxruntime.dll, about 40 MB, and it runs on any Direct3D 12 GPU -
               NVIDIA, AMD or Intel. The slow one, but it works out of the box
               on every machine.
  TensorRT-RTX ships with this package too. NVIDIA RTX only, 20-series and
               newer. About 250 MB installed. "The TensorRT-RTX files" below is
               what it is made of.
  MIGraphX     AMD only. Faster than DirectML, 385 MB installed, and the one
               backend here that is still fetched on demand.

How much TensorRT-RTX is worth depends entirely on the model. On an RTX 5060,
rescaling a 1500x844 descale of a 1080p source, measured over the rescale alone:

  ArtCNN C4F32   33 fps on TensorRT-RTX, 32 fps on DirectML
  ArtCNN R8F64   17 fps on TensorRT-RTX, 11 fps on DirectML

C4F32 is small enough that neither backend is the bottleneck - the descale, the
masks and the downscale are - so the choice barely shows. R8F64 is where the
backend does the work, and where the download pays for itself. A full filter
chain with a dehalo in it moves both numbers down together.

MIGraphX comes from the vs-mlrt release this package is pinned to, with curl and
the 7z.exe in the VapourSynth folder, and is unpacked into VapourSynth\\vs-plugins.
Pinning matters: the plugin DLLs and the runtime folders that go with them are
versioned together, and mixing releases is what produces "unable to load" errors
that look like a broken install.

Full TensorRT is deliberately not one of the choices. It is the faster of the two
NVIDIA paths, but it wants vsmlrt-cuda for the plugin (2.6 GB to download, 3.5 GB
installed) and NVIDIA's tensorrt_cu13_libs wheel for the engine builder that
vs-jetpack 2 drives (1.9 GB more). TensorRT-RTX does the same job for the models
this package uses in 250 MB, and builds its engine in under a second rather than
minutes.

A vs-mlrt plugin DLL and its runtime folder (vsmlrt-cuda, vsmlrt-hip) are looked
for next to each other - the DLL builds an absolute path to that folder out of
its own location and gives up if nothing is there - so both land in the same
directory. The archives already carry the folder names, so they are simply
extracted alongside the DLL.

--- The TensorRT-RTX files -------------------------------------------------

Four things have to be in place, and all four ship with the package:

    Lib\\site-packages\\vapoursynth\\plugins\\vstrt_rtx.dll
        the plugin, out of VSTRT-RTX-Windows-x64 in the pinned vs-mlrt release.
    Lib\\site-packages\\vapoursynth\\plugins\\vsmlrt-cuda\\
        tensorrt_rtx_1_4.dll and tensorrt_onnxparser_rtx_1_4.dll, out of
        NVIDIA's tensorrt_rtx_cu13_libs wheel. vstrt_rtx.dll preloads the first
        of those by absolute path from its own folder, which is why the runtime
        sits here instead of in site-packages where the wheel puts it.
    Lib\\site-packages\\tensorrt_rtx_bindings, tensorrt_rtx, tensorrt_rtx_libs
        the Python side. vs-jetpack 2 builds the engine through the tensorrt_rtx
        module rather than through trtexec, so the bindings are not optional.
        tensorrt_rtx and tensorrt_rtx_libs are two short files written by hand:
        NVIDIA publishes the first only as an sdist that pip would have to
        build, and the second is what loads the runtime out of vsmlrt-cuda
        instead of keeping a second 200 MB copy of it.
    Lib\\site-packages\\cuda
        cuda-core, with cuda-bindings and cuda-pathfinder under it, which
        vsscale uses to select the CUDA device before it builds an engine.

The versions are tied together: the plugin reports the TensorRT-RTX version it
was built against - 1.4.0 for v15.16 - and vsscale refuses to run if the Python
bindings do not match it to the patch number. To rebuild the set, run this from
the VapourSynth folder

    python.exe -m pip install --no-deps --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
        tensorrt_rtx_cu13_bindings==1.4.0.76 tensorrt_rtx_cu13_libs==1.4.0.76
    python.exe -m pip install cuda-core cuda-bindings

then move the two DLLs out of site-packages\\tensorrt_rtx_libs into the
plugins\\vsmlrt-cuda folder above, leaving that package's hand-written
__init__.py in place.

Two things moved in vs-jetpack 2 and are no longer this file's business. The
ArtCNN ONNX models used to sit in vs-plugins\\models; vsscale now resolves them
out of a .vsjet folder beside the running script, falling back to a per-user
cache under AppData. Neither is any use to a portable package - every script
that asks for a model here is a rendered copy in a temp folder, and AppData does
not travel with the folder - so vpy_template.render() puts a few lines on the
front of any rendered script that uses vsscale, redirecting the first of those
lookups to VapourSynth\\.vsjet, where this package keeps the models. They go
there with

    python.exe -c "from vsscale.mlrt.cli import app; app()" onnx download ArtCNN --latest

run from the VapourSynth folder, which is the directory vsscale's downloader
hangs its .vsjet off. The Scripts\\vsscale.exe launcher is not used: like the
other Scripts launchers it carries the build machine's python path and exits
without doing anything here. That is also why directml_installed() below no
longer looks for the models. That same redirect is what decides where a built
TensorRT engine is cached - VapourSynth\\.vsjet\\vsscale\\artifact - so engines
travel with the package too.

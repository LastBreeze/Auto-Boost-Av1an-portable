"""Optional hand-written VapourSynth filtering script: video-input\\template.vpy.

Auto-Boost, Av1an single pass and Condor normally generate a .vpy per input from
settings.txt. That covers crop/downscale/dehalo/denoise/deband and nothing else,
so anything settings.txt has no key for - a rescale, an AA pass, a custom mask, a
second denoiser - cannot be expressed at all.

bat-builder.py's "Setup advanced tools" menu can now write video-input\\template.vpy:
the filter chain settings.txt describes, written out as a plain script in the
style of video-input\\example.vpy. While that file exists, the three dispatchers
stop generating and use it instead. Delete or rename it and they go back to
generating, exactly as before - this is opt-in and absent on every existing
install.

The template is used verbatim apart from one substitution, the one value the
file cannot know for itself:

  replace.mkv   the placeholder path in the source line becomes the file being
                encoded. This is the same convention example.vpy already uses.

The crop is the template's own. Its std.Crop line is passed through untouched,
and settings.txt's [crop] keys - along with the .bat --autocrop switch - stop
applying the moment the file exists: a chain the user edits by hand cannot also
be rewritten per input without the two disagreeing about which crop is real. The
template writer seeds the line from settings.txt once, when the file is created;
after that it is the user's, and deleting the line means no crop. crop=auto has
no equivalent here, so an auto user has to put real numbers in that line -
template-preview.bat is how to check them.

Nothing else is touched: no injected imports, no plugin loading, no wrapper. The
package sets VAPOURSYNTH_EXTRA_PLUGIN_PATH before anything runs, so plain
imports and core.<plugin> calls resolve the same way they do in example.vpy.

bat-builder.py's template page asks which rescale the file should have before it
writes it: none at all, DirectML (any GPU) or NVIDIA TensorRT-RTX. Pick one and
block goes out switched on - a descale to the show's native resolution, ArtCNN to
rebuild it, credit and line masks, and a downscale back - with its imports inside
the block, so a template written without a rescale never pays for them. What is
left for the user is new_height and the descale kernel, the two values that
cannot be known in advance. See tools/mlrt_backend.py for the backend files.

The block is written against vs-jetpack 2, which reorganised all of this: the
rescale is vsscale.Rescale (vodesfunc.RescaleBuilder is gone), the inference
backend is vsscale.Backend (the standalone vsmlrt module is gone), and ArtCNN's
ONNX models are no longer shipped alongside the plugin. The package carries its
own copy of them in VapourSynth\\.vsjet, which is the folder
model_storage_preamble() below points a rendered script at. See the comment above
MODEL_STORAGE_PREAMBLE for why they sit there and not beside the script.

Two things the template cannot do, because they are per-run .bat flags rather
than part of a filter chain: --tonemap and --convert-to-YUV420P10. The
dispatchers refuse a tonemap run against a template (silently encoding HDR as if
it were SDR wastes the whole encode) and warn about the conversion, in both cases
pointing at the template as the place to do it.

One hard rule: do not change the frame count. Scene detection
(Progressive-Scene-Detection.py) reads the source file directly, and av1an trims
this script to the frame ranges that detection produced. A trim or a splice here
puts the last scene past the end of the clip and the encode dies on an empty
chunk. Crop, resize and any per-frame filter are fine.

Consumers:
  * Auto-Boost-Av1an.py   (Auto-Boost two pass, via dispatch.py)
  * av1an-dispatch.py     (Av1an single pass)
  * condor-dispatch.py    (Condor; reuses av1an-dispatch's .vpy builder)
  * template-preview.py   (video-input\\template-preview.bat)
LQTC decodes without VapourSynth, so it ignores this file.

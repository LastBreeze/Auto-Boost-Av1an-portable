"""Python backend for x264-filter.bat.

Builds a lossless (or near-lossless) x264 intermediary for every video in the
video-input folder, with the settings.txt filter chain already applied.

Three steps per file, no av1an involved:

  1. tools\\av1an-dispatch.py builds the .vpy from settings.txt.
  2. VapourSynth\\VSPipe.exe pipes that script as y4m into tools\\av1an\\x264.exe,
     which writes a raw <name>.h264 elementary stream into temp\\x264-filter.
  3. tools\\MKVToolNix\\mkvmerge.exe muxes the .h264 into
     <name>-x264filter.mkv, written next to the source file.

The filter chain is not reimplemented here. This script imports
tools\\av1an-dispatch.py and calls its build_vapoursynth_script(), so crop,
HDR tonemap, dehalo, denoise, deband and downscale come out of settings.txt
exactly as they do for the AV1 encodes, and cannot drift from them.

The .mkv is VIDEO ONLY. A VapourSynth script carries nothing but video, so no
audio, subtitles, chapters or attachments are carried over from the source.

Once a source has been filtered, it is moved into the package's originals
folder. The intermediary is written next to it in video-input, so leaving the
source there would queue both of them on the next encode.

settings.txt is only read, never written. The av1an .bat files flip
denoise=True/False in settings.txt through their DENOISE= line before they
dispatch; this script uses whatever settings.txt already says.

Run it through x264-filter.bat, or directly:
    ..\\VapourSynth\\python.exe x264-filter.py

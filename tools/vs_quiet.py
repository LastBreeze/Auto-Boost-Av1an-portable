"""Suppress the VapourSynth core's plugin-load chatter.

VapourSynth R79 logs a warning for every plugin that still uses API3, and one
more for every DLL that exists in two plugin folders at once. Neither is
actionable from here - the plugins load and work - but they bury the pipeline's
real output, so they are filtered out of the "vapoursynth" logger.

Call silence_plugin_noise() BEFORE anything touches vs.core. Importing
vapoursynth is fine; it is the first *core access* that triggers the autoload
which emits these messages, and a filter added after that is too late.

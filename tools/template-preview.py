"""Preview video-input\\template.vpy against the untouched source.

The companion to settings-preview.py. That one previews the chain settings.txt
would generate; this one previews the hand-edited template.vpy that replaces it,
so what you see here is exactly what av1an, Auto-Boost and Condor will encode -
the same renderer, filling in the same one thing: the source path. The crop is
whatever the template's own std.Crop line says, here and at encode time.

Launched by video-input\\template-preview.bat, which bat-builder.py writes next
to the template.

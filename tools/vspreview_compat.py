"""Launcher that starts VSPreview with the vs-jetpack 2 rename bridged.

VSPreview 0.20.1 - the newest release there is - does

    from vstools import vs, vs_object

in vspreview\\plugins\\utils.py. vs-jetpack 2 renamed that class to VSObject, so
on a current install VSPreview dies during import, before any window appears:

    ImportError: cannot import name 'vs_object' from 'vstools'.
                 Did you mean: 'VSObject'?

vspreview declares "vsjetpack>=1.1.0" with no upper bound, so pip installs the
two happily side by side and the mismatch only shows up at launch. VSObject is
the same class under a new name - nothing about it changed - so putting the old
name back on the module is the whole fix.

Two other names VSPreview reaches for are bridged the same way: DitherType's
is_fmtc property, and set_output, which vs-jetpack 2 moved out of vstools and
into vspreview.api. Without the latter, VSPreview's own VSSource Loader plugin
dies on "cannot import name 'set_output' from 'vstools'" every launch.

The alias is applied here rather than by editing site-packages\\vspreview,
because a patched third-party package is undone by the next pip install and
leaves nothing behind to explain why it was patched. Run this file instead of
"python -m vspreview" and VSPreview gets its argv exactly as it would have:

    VapourSynth\\python.exe tools\\vspreview_compat.py script.vpy [args...]

vspreview-dispatch.py's launch_command() builds that line, and the three places
that open a previewer - template-preview.py, settings-preview.py and
photon-test.py - all go through it.

Delete this file and go back to "python -m vspreview" once VSPreview ships a
release built against vs-jetpack 2, or once the package moves to vsview, the
successor previewer from the same authors.
